BL09 experiment data processing workflows for tomography and spectroscopy 
processing.

The goal of this project is to create different workflows in order to process
the Mistral data.

Following scripts are available:

- txrm2norm: from raw data to normalized data
- txrm2ali: from raw data to aligned projections
- norm2recons: from normalized data to reconstructed tomography (old:fastrecons)
- txrm2recons: from txrm raw data to reconstructed tomography
- hdf52recons: from hdf5 raw data to reconstructed tomography 
- ali2recons: from aligned to reconstructed tomography
